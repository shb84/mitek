# SAMPLE MATLAB CODE

Sample Matlab code to load a timeseries from local CSV file, plot it, and save to PNG.

_This project is a MATLAB coding test as part of an interview for Mitek, 
written in Matlab 2024a._  

```
 A.  Produce documented Matlab code that does the following.
 Reads datasets consisting of two csv files
  - File 1, data file
	has two columns: date, value
  - File 2, config file
	has three columns: key,value,comment 
	specifies the following features of the output plot
    	   Mean value line show or not 
    	   Linear data fit line show or not 
	   xlabel
           ylabel  
 The code writes PNG plot file showing
  - data
  - fit lines, as specified in the config file
  - line legends
  - xlabel ylabel 
  - title: ylabel vs xlabel
 Documentation
   - Code has built in documentation, heavy comments  
 Three test datasets should be included

B. Produce GitHub page with 
 - project description
 - functionality description
 - user instructions  
 - data interface specs
 - explanation of the results in the generated PNG

C. Test response time will be evaluated
